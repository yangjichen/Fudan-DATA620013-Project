## Project: DATA620013

*For details, please see `Project.pdf` and `Final Project_杨继琛.pdf`*

The files digits.RData contain the same training and test data of handwritten digit images for R. There are 10 digits classes. Each digit image consists of binary values 0’s and 1’s only. There are 500 training images and 1000 test images per digit class. The whole training set is stored in a 10 × 500 × 20 × 20 array. The goal of this project is to experiment with different classifiers for this data set: 

1. LDA

2. Mixture of Bernoulli’s

For each classifier you will report the error rate on the test set.
